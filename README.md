# microspot

This work is developed within a collaboration between the Innovation and Robotics department of bq and the research project MalariaSpot of the Technical University of Madrid.

The purpose of this work is the development of a mobile-microscope, a device composed of a mobile phone, an optical system and a mechanical system to magnify and scan objects. Our intention is to use this device for remote diagnosis of malaria and tuberculosis in regions where there is no medical personnel or microscopes. The objects we need to scan are slides with a blood smear, in the case of malaria diagnosis, or a sputum smear in the case of tuberculosis.
